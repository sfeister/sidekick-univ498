# Arduino

Each BeagleBone Black Rev. 3 has exactly one or more Arduino Nanos attached. The BeagleBone Black sends commands and receives data from the Arduino(s) via USB.

Each .ino sketch in this folder is compiled and uploaded to an Arduino Nano. Then, the Arduino is plugged into a BeagleBone Black via USB. A USB hub is used as needed, since the BeagleBone Black has only one USB port.
